# Tour
 - ~link-Live~ -> Prebuilt binaries (Pi4b/ARM 32 bit) of projects in ~link-project~ that are in a production state (at least on my specific machine).
 - ~link-project~ -> C++ project sources with visual studio solution/project files.
 - ~link-resources~ -> Resources used with programs (ex. html's for webserver, csv's for task-parsers).
 - ~link-scripts~ -> (OLD) Python scripts that were originally used as production equivilants for the binaries in ~link-Live~.
