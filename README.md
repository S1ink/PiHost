# PiHost 
## What is PiHost?
 _**PiHost is a (personal) project aimed at managing gpio, displaying and logging information, directing backups/syncing of files, and other basic tasks - an autonomous HOST for raspberry PI.**_
## Quick Info
 - PiHost was originally scripted in Python, but is now only being actively developed in C++. (Python code is located within the "scripts" folder)
 - All C++ source files are located under the "build" folder. Some files may appear twice and organization may be not great because they are copied by Visual Studio. (Hopefully I will fix this in the future)
 - The "Live" folder contains prebuilt binaries - see disclaimers below.
