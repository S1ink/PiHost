# About
This is just some quality of life code that I have developed and use frequently in my projects (remnants are visible in my other repos). I have tried to make as much of the code cross-platform, but some is specific to a single platform. These files are contained within a folder titled by platform. Some libraries that I also commonly implement (or are used in this repo) include:
  - Pigpio: https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio
  - MegaMimes (for HTTP): https://github.com/trumpowen/MegaMimes
